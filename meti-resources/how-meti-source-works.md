# How METI Source Works

METI™ (MillPont Environmental Trust Infrastructure) operates as a geospatial clearinghouse, transforming environmental asset management in agricultural supply chains by embedding verifiable trust into sustainable exchanges. At its core, METI Source introduces **Secure Source IDs (SSIDs)**—digital deeds linked to [Sources ](what-is-a-source.md)of environmental outcomes. These digital deeds provide a secure, dynamic, and interoperable framework to connect agricultural value chains with environmental markets.

## **Secure Source IDs (SSIDs)**&#x20;

SSIDs are **digital deeds** that transform how environmental outcomes are tracked, verified, and managed. By linking each Source to an SSID, METI enables:

* **Ownership Verification & Validation**: Each SSID is tied to a specific Source and its environmental outcomes, ensuring accurate claims and compliance with market standards - mitigating double-counting and greenwashing.
* **Security**: Encrypted identifiers protect data integrity and ownership while safeguarding against fraud or duplication.
* **Interoperability**: SSIDs are designed to integrate seamlessly with multiple platforms, markets, and regulatory frameworks, reducing friction across supply chains, registries, and marketplaces.
* **Dynamic Functionality**: SSIDs evolve over time, capturing updates to claims, monitoring status changes, and ensuring outcomes remain relevant and actionable.

## How METI Works: Step-by-Step Process

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Submission of Sources**

METI Members (e.g., ARVA Intelligence) submit **Sources** from agricultural projects to METI’s Clearinghouse. These Sources include:

* **Geospatial boundaries** of project fields.
* **Management timelines** specifying the duration of claims (Valid From – Valid To).

***
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Data Processing in the Clearinghouse**

The Clearinghouse:

* Reformats and processes submitted data leveraging [advanced encryption](https://csrc.nist.gov/Presentations/2023/stppa6-iso-iec-fhe) algorithms, ensuring comparable consistency while preserving privacy and identifiable information.
* Compares the submitted information against existing network claims and public data sources (e.g. geographically referenceable Voluntary Carbon Market projects on Verra, CAR, ACR, Gold Standard, etc.) to validate exclusivity.

***
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Issuance of Encrypted Deeds**

After validation, METI issues **SSIDs** as **digital deeds** for each Source. These SSIDs are stored in the **Source Ledger** along with:

* Metadata about the Source’s origin, ownership, and current status.
* Verification and encryption protocols ensuring right-to-claim ownership and traceability.

***
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Linking SSIDs to Verified Outcomes**

METI Members link SSIDs to specific environmental outcomes, such as carbon credits, Scope 3 claims, and or CI-certificates. This approach ensures:

* **Transparency and Integrity**: Outcome claims are clearly documented, with traceable and verifiable ownership for buyers and stakeholders.
* **Conflict Mitigation**: Double-counting is prevented, and ownership claims are clearly established, with mechanisms in place to resolve disputes when conflicts arise.

***
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Authentication and Ongoing Monitoring**

Buyers (e.g., Nestlé Purina) or third-party auditors authenticate claims via the METI Source Ledger.

* SSIDs are **continuously monitored** to:
  * Ensure exclusivity and prevent double-counting.
  * Verify ongoing compliance with [Rulebook](../meti-operative-documents/source-rulebook-draft.md) standards until the claim’s expiration.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## **Key Benefits**&#x20;

* **Trust and Transparency**: SSIDs provide verifiable and traceable assurance of environmental claims ownership.
* **Scalable Market Integration**: Interoperability ensures compatibility across platforms, registries, and value chains.
* **Dynamic Accountability**: SSIDs adapt to updates in environmental outcomes and ownership, ensuring continuous relevance and detection of conflicts - historically and on an ongoing basis. &#x20;
* **Efficient Ownership Management**: SSIDs simplify complex transactions by creating a secure, traceable link between Sources and outcomes, ensuring claims are unique, exclusive, and readily auditable.&#x20;

METI empowers stakeholders to connect agricultural value chains with climate markets, fostering a sustainable future. By leveraging SSIDs as digital deeds, METI ensures that environmental claims are not just credible but also verifiable, authentic, and traceable at scale. &#x20;
