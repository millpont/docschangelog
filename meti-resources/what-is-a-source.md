# What is a Source?

## Definition

A **Source** refers to the point of origin of an environmental benefit. For METI, a Source is considered an individual contiguous parcel or facility that is the smallest unit of land with the following characteristics:

1. **A permanent, contiguous boundary**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample:_ A 40-acre field used for regenerative grazing, surrounded by roads or fences that clearly define its edges.
2. **A common land cover and land management**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample:_ A corn field with cover cropping and no-till practices applied across the entire parcel.
3. **Common ownership or group of owners/land managers**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample:_ A pasture owned by a farming cooperative or managed jointly by a family under a single operational agreement.
4. **A common project administrator or project proponent (i.e., Custodian)**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample:_ A reforestation project led by a local conservation NGO overseeing multiple parcels within a watershed program.

These criteria ensure that each Source is distinctly identifiable, manageable, and accurately linked to its environmental outcomes.

## Example

Below is an example of three fields that meet METI’s definition of a Source. Each field represents a distinct, contiguous parcel of land with a defined boundary, consistent land cover and management practices, and shared oversight by a common project administrator (i.e. Custodian). These fields demonstrate how Sources are clearly delineated and aligned with METI’s standards for secure environmental asset tracking.

* **Field ID: 1**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x43;rop Type:_ Corn\
  &#xNAN;_&#x4D;anagement Practices:_ No-Till
* **Field ID: 2**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x43;rop Type:_ Soybeans\
  &#xNAN;_&#x4D;anagement Practices:_ No-Till & Cover Crops
* **Field ID: 3**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x43;rop Type:_ Wheat\
  &#xNAN;_&#x4D;anagement Practices:_ No-Till & Cover Crops

This example highlights how Sources are identified and differentiated based on specific attributes, ensuring accurate and consistent tracking of environmental outcomes.
