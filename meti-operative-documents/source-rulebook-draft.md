## 1.     OVERVIEW

### **1.1.**   **Purpose**

**(a)** A core document of the MillPont Environmental Trust Infrastructure ("METI") clearinghouse platform, the METI Source Rulebook (the “Rulebook”) outlines the guidelines and protocols that govern the operations of the METI Source Ledger (“MSL”). The MSL is designed to provide a verifiable and transparent means for managing Secure Source Identifiers (“SSIDs”) tied to Environmental Attribute Certificates (“EACs”) across independent attribute tracking systems and critical font- and back-office operations in various agricultural commodities and value chains.

**(b)** The Rulebook incorporates over two decades of best practices in environmental attribute tracking, aligned with both the [International Attribute Tracking Standard](https://www.trackingstandard.org/the-standard/) (“IATS”) and [the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (“CFTC”) No Double-Counting Guidance](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-23105/p-440) to prevent duplicative claims and double issuances of EACs. Through the MSL, METI enables Market Participants to securely submit, verify, and manage geospatial, temporal and attribute data, ensuring each source is uniquely registered, comparable and traceable through the EAC lifecycle in compliance with global standards for data accuracy, non-duplication, and operational transparency.

### **1.2.   Scope**

This Rulebook applies to all METI Originate Members, partners, and stakeholders involved in data submission, verification, and claim management through the MSL. It covers the full data lifecycle from initial submission to claim verification, including data security measures, periodic audits, and procedures for SSID conflict resolution. The comprehensive approach ensures that MSL represents the highest industry standards for accuracy, non-duplication, and reliable reporting. This Rulebook supplements the METI Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”). In the event of any conflict, the Terms of Use provisions take precedence.

### &#x20;**1.3.** **General Definitions**

* **Account:** A data store within METI attributed to a single Entity, used for interacting with METI clearing services and ledgers. &#x20;
* **Beneficiary:** An individual, entity, or organization that receives the intangible property rights and the quantified environmental benefits conveyed through EACs. Beneficiaries can include, but are not limited to, stakeholders such as investors, public entities, private organizations, NGOs, or other parties entitled to the benefits generated by sustainable practices and interventions documented, registered, and transferred via METI.
* **Custodian:** An individual, entity, or organization responsible for the custody, management, and administrative oversight of one or more Secure Source Identifiers. Custodians ensure the proper issuance, distribution, and tracking of these identifiers, and may also underwrite Environmental Attribute Certificates associated with the Secure Source Identifiers. Custodians must have active commercial agreements with Source owners (i.e., Landowners or Operators) or Beneficiaries with agreements tied to the Source owners. They are required to adhere to all applicable Terms of Use and Rulebook standards related to data integrity and compliance.
* **Omnibus Custodian:** An Omnibus Custodian is an entity, typically an MRV Provider designated by one or more primary Custodians, to manage SSIDs and underwrite EACs on their behalf. Omnibus Custodians require a Declaration of Agency with METI (See Appendix 1), indicating formal authorization to administer these assets. An Omnibus Custodian is subject to the Terms of Use, relevant Rulebook/s, and financial responsibilities for the METI clearing services it utilizes on behalf of the individual or organization it holds an Account for.
* **Entity:** An Entity is any legally recognized organization, institution, or individual that participates in the METI Source framework. Entities may include, but are not limited to, corporations, partnerships, non-governmental organizations, governmental bodies, and individuals acting as Custodians, Market Participants, or Beneficiaries. Each Entity is accountable for adhering to the METI Source Rulebook and associated Terms of Use, and is authorized to interact with the METI Platform, manage Accounts, and engage in SSID-related transactions under METI’s compliance and verification standards.
* **Environmental Attribute Certificate (or Claim) (“EAC”):** A tradeable instrument representing intangible property rights used to quantify, verify, and track the ecosystem service benefits of climate mitigation projects. EACs may vary in their traceability, supporting ownership claims for activities like carbon reduction and renewable energy production.
* **Know Your Customer (“KYC”):** The “know your customer” and other counterparty evaluation criteria as implemented on the basis of applicable laws or otherwise applied in accordance with good industry practice.
* **Labelling Authority:** An organization that sets criteria for certifying EACs against its standards, ensuring compliance with specific guidelines (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard).
* **Landowner or Operator:** One or more related entities which owns and or operates the Source of an EAC. Landowners and Operators can be individuals, organizations, and or groups of individuals or organizations which operate under similar ownership or organizational structures, produce similar goods or services, and are located in close regional proximity to each other.
* **Local Working Instructions (“LWIs”):** A document or set of documents maintained and adopted by the Custodian that defines the procedures and standards for the creation, issuance, management, and distribution of EACs. These instructions ensure that the quality and integrity of the EACs can be defined and assessed against best practices and leading scientific standards.
* **Market Participants:** Entities directly involved in EAC transactions who manage METI Accounts and exercise discretionary control over their data. Market Participants may designate third parties to manage their Accounts via a Declaration of Agency. Market Participants include Land Owners and Operators, Custodians and Beneficiaries.
* **Members and Membership Status:** Organizations or individuals affiliated with METI through the METI Originate program, recognized by the METI Administrator as compliant with the Terms of Use and relevant Rulebook(s) for the clearing service(s) they use. Membership status reflects the Administrator’s confirmation of a member’s adherence to METI’s standards for custodianship, data accuracy, and operational integrity.
* **METI Administrator:** MillPont, Inc., the designated manager of METI, responsible for implementing the Rulebook’s principles and overseeing platform operations.
* **METI Originate:** A program that provides Market Participants with privileged access to METI’s clearing services and rights for the creation, modification, and management of records, including the METI Source Ledger.
* **METI Platform:** A comprehensive system that provides open market clearing services through secure ledgers to facilitate the creation, verification, and management of SSIDs and EACs. Operating independently of specific registries, MRV platforms, or programs/projects, METI Source engages directly with diverse Market Participants to enhance collaboration, transparency, and coordination across independently managed systems.
* **METI Source Ledger ("MSL"):** An electronic accounting ledger within the METI Platform that records, stores, and tracks data submissions and claims associated with SSIDs and their linked EACs. The Source Ledger maintains a transparent chain of custody and ensures the secure, verifiable provenance of environmental claims, particularly in agricultural production systems. Serving as the foundational tool for establishing and securing the exclusivity of EAC ownership, it also prevents the duplication of EAC issuances at the point of origin, supporting the integrity and trustworthiness of environmental transactions.
* **MRV Platform:** A Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification platform that collects, validates, and reports data related to environmental activities linked to EACs. MRV Platforms support accurate EAC issuance by integrating field data, remote sensing, and audits to maintain verified environmental impacts. MRV Platforms can integrate with the METI Source Ledger providing validated data to create and manage SSIDs, ensuring traceability and transparency. &#x20;
* **MRV Provider:** An entity that administers MRV Platforms and supports data collection and reporting tied to SSIDs and EACs. Providers verify SSID data and measure the environmental benefits being produced from climate mitigation activities and ensure ongoing auditing, compliance, and transparent environmental outcome tracking. The functions of an MRV Provider can be embedded in a Custodian’s organization (i.e., Unified Entity) and or they can operate independently as third-party auditor and verification partner.
* **Omnibus Custodian:** The individual or organization responsible for the management, administration, and oversight of one or more SSIDs and EACs on behalf of another individual or organization. An Omnibus Custodian has a signed Declaration of Agency Form (See Appendix 1) on file with the Administration for each Omnibus Custodian Account it oversees and administers on the Source Ledger.
* **Registry:** A database that records the ownership, issuance, transfer, and redemption of EACs. Registries may be public or private and can serve as Labeling Authorities or support multiple labels.
* **Resolution Period:** A timeframe, designated by METI Administrator, during which any detected incompatibility or conflict between SSIDs must be resolved. This period allows for an investigation and corrective actions to be taken to ensure the accurate tracking and integrity of environmental claims tied to SSIDs.
* **Secure Source Identifier (“SSID”):** A unique and addressable digital statement that represents exclusivity over a geographic extent for a period of time for a specific type of environmental attribute. SSIDs incorporate geospatial, temporal, and attribute ownership data to ensure secure and verifiable provenance for claims. They support data integrity, traceability, and facilitate easy comparison across different platforms and workflows. They are represented via a unique 16-character identifier which can be reference on the METI Source Ledger.
* **Source:** For agricultural-based projects, a source is the point of origin of an EAC, an identifiable measurement point at the beginning of the EAC lifecycle, and is considered an individual contiguous parcel that is the smallest unit of land with: 1) A permanent, contiguous boundary; 2) Common land cover, management practice, or operational facility; 3) Common ownership or group of Land Owners and Operators, and; 4) A common project administrator (i.e. Custodian).&#x20;
* **Unified Entity**: A Unified Entity is a Custodian organization that holds dual roles, acting both as the administrator and verifier of SSID data within the METI Source framework. This designation allows the organization to validate SSID-related data internally rather than through an independent third-party auditor.

### **1.4.   Organizational Structure**

The Rulebook serves as an overarching governance document for METI’s Source Ledger, ensuring consistent application of the platform’s principles and procedures. The governance structure is led by the METI Governance Committee composed of industry stakeholders, METI Originate Members, and independent experts who provide strategic oversight and guidance. This committee plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and alignment of the Rulebook with best practices and evolving industry standards.

All operations are conducted in accordance with applicable laws and standards across jurisdictions to maintain legal integrity and market trust.

## 4.     CUSTODIAN RESPONSIBILITIES AND REQUIREMENTS

### 4.1.   General Responsibilities

The main responsibility of a Custodian is to facilitate the registration of SSIDs and underwrite and manage EACs for which the Custodian maintains contractual rights to administer. A Custodian may be any form of a legally recognizable entity, including a government authority, non-governmental organization, and or commercial enterprise.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.1.1. Commercial Relationships**</mark>_&#x20;

The registration and management of SSIDs on the METI Source Ledger requires auditable commercial agreements between the Custodian and the underlying Landowner/s and Operator/s, and or, between the Custodian and Beneficiary/s who may hold the commercial relationship and agreements with the Land Owner/s and Operator/s. The commercial agreements should clearly define the services provided and ensure that the registration and management of SSIDs is aligned with those services. A Custodian may not request and manage any SSID they are not authorized to do so by a commercial agreement. Any deviations from commercial terms that would alter or remove the rights to administer SSIDs by the Custodian should be discussed with METI Administration to ensure adherence to the Principle of Data Integrity and Accuracy.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.1.2. Minimum  Qualifications**</mark>_

Custodians are required to have appropriate training, staff, and a degree of professionalism consistent with good industry practice and shall demonstrate competence to operate in the capacity for which they are serving Market Participants. This includes complying with METI’s KYC requirements and proper registration, accreditation, and licensing in compliance with the legislation in the geographies and countries wherever Custodians provide services.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.1.3. SSID Requests**</mark>_

Only a registered Custodian may request, manage and modify an SSID issued by METI. SSID requests can only be made when a Custodian has satisfied the commercial agreements required to evidence that an SSID issued on the METI Source Ledger is a unique and exclusive representation of the relevant Source for a given time period and environmental attribute. SSID requests may not be made in speculation, or prior to the effective date of administration as evidenced by the relevant commercial agreement/s. &#x20;

### 4.2.   Membership Requirements

Custodians shall demonstrate competence to operate in the capacity for which they are required by the METI Source Rulebook. The Administration has sole authority to assess the adequacy of adherence to the Rulebook’s requirements and grant or revoke any resulting Membership. The Administration may grant conditional or limited Membership where there are concerns related to competition, legislative implementation, or other requirements related to adherence to best practice. Unless explicitly stated, the following requirements shall apply to all Custodial Members and evidence of ongoing compliance with these requirements shall form part of the annual membership accreditation and verification process outlined in [Section 7](source-rulebook-draft.md#id-7.-annual-compliance-verification).  &#x20;

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.2.1. Know Your Customer (KYC)**</mark>_

Consistent with good industry practice and to comply with applicable law relating to anti-money laundering and prevention of fraud, illicit proceeds from crimes or sanctioned activities, METI Administrators shall verify:

**(a)** Identity of any natural person with controlling ownership, and or, at least one officer of the Custodian;

**(b)** Legal Address of the Custodian;

**(c)** Appropriate legal and fiscal registration of the Custodian;

**(d)** Appropriate Local Working Instructions (LWIs).

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.2.2. Fraud Prevention**</mark>_

**(a)** Custodians have a responsibility to act legally and in accordance with any agreed contracts. Where the actions of Custodians raise concerns that the integrity of METI Source Ledger may be compromised, whether by malicious intent or through poor practice, METI Administration may take appropriate actions permitted under law to maintain the integrity of the METI Source Ledger and reputation and operations of its collective Members.

**(b)** Any Custodian that suspects fraudulent activity, money laundering, tax evasion, or other illegal activity should report such a suspicion confidentially to METI Administration and the relevant authorities for review. Custodians may at any time contact relevant authorities in relation to suspicious activity or concerns related to fraud.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.2.3. Local Working Instructions**</mark>_

Custodians shall create, maintain, and operate Local Working Instructions (“LWIs”) that must comply with METI’s Terms of Use and Rulebook/s. METI Administration may review LWIs as part of the onboarding and Know Your Customer process. LWIs must clearly document how Custodians guarantee unique issuance of each EAC and exclusive chain of custody using SSIDs. The steps or checks made to ensure this unique issuance and exclusive chain of custody must be documented in a manner that is easily understood by external stakeholders. Defined aspects of LWIs include:

**(a)** **Geographical and Temporal Restrictions:** A Custodian shall request, manage, and administer the registration of Sources, and any affiliated temporal and attribute data, solely within the geographical and temporal scope for which it is authorized and engaged as a Custodian by the Market Participants.

**(b) Commercial Restrictions:** Custodians shall only request the registration of Sources, and manage and administer SSIDs, for which they have established commercial agreements. Custodians may act in this capacity only when formally engaged as a Custodian by Market Participants.

**(c) Records Management:** A Custodian must define how it maintains records to ensure:

&#x20;     **(i)** The Custodian satisfies KYC requirements of this Rulebook;

&#x20;     **(ii)** The Land Owners and Operators satisfy the KYC requirements of the Custodian;

&#x20;     **(iii)** The Custodian is legally able to contract on behalf of Land Owners and Operators, and or Beneficiaries, for the administration of SSIDs;

&#x20;     **(iv)** The Custodian is not or has not engaged in fraudulent activities;

&#x20;     **(v)** The Land Owners and Operators are not or have not engaged in fraudulent activities;

&#x20;     **(iv)** All supporting documents submitted in support of establishing the unique and exclusive characteristics of a SSID;

&#x20;     **(iiv)** These documents and records must be maintained throughout the lifecycle of a SSID and for at least three years after expiration.

**(d)** **Process Outlines:** The prospective Custodian must clearly define, in its LWIs, the process by which it will enroll Land Owners’ and Operators’ Sources and manage EACs produced. The Custodian must also outline how the specific steps related to registering the Sources/requesting SSIDs are completed on the METI Source Ledger.

**(e) Data Maintenance:** A Custodian must establish and document protocols to ensure that all registration data associated with Sources and affiliated SSIDs remains current and accurate. The registration of a Source may expire after a defined period from the date of its initial registration, as specified in the commercial agreement/s between a Custodian and Land Owner and Operator. Registration can be renewed or extended by the Custodian upon renewal or extension of the commercial agreements between the parties.

**(f) Change Management for Registered Sources:** After a Source has been registered and an SSID issued on the Source Ledger, the Custodians must implement procedures to identify, review, and validate any modifications to the Source that may impact the validity of the information the Source Ledger. These procedures should ensure that all changes are assessed to maintain the integrity and accuracy of METI’s services.

**(g) Supporting Evidence Requirements:** LWIs shall detail how SSIDs are issued based on verifiable evidence they represent a unique and exclusive Source. Evidence supporting the issuance of SSID must include for a specified time:

&#x20;     **(i)** A permanent, contiguous boundary;

&#x20;     **(ii)** Common land cover, management practice, or operational facility;

&#x20;     **(iii)** Common ownership or group of Landowners and Operators, and;

&#x20;     **(iv)** A common project administrator (i.e. Custodian).

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.2.4. Third-Party Verification**</mark>_

Custodians shall not conduct verification of SSIDs for which they are the Custodian unless recognized as a Unified Entity by METI Administration. Custodians may engage independent third-party auditors or verification bodies to confirm SSID-related data as per Rulebook requirements. Custodians shall submit verification documentation to Administration upon request and maintain these records for a minimum period of three years following SSID expiration. This documentation must be readily accessible for METI’s audit and compliance reviews.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.2.5. Unified Entity Requirements**</mark>_

A Unified Entity is a Custodian organization that holds dual roles, acting both as the administrator and verifier of SSID data within the METI Source framework. This designation allows the organization to validate SSID-related data internally rather than through an independent third-party auditor. This status is typically reserved for Custodians with advanced verification infrastructure and proven adherence to METI’s transparency, traceability, and data integrity protocols. To qualify as a Unified Entity, the Custodian must receive formal recognition from METI Administration during Account onboarding and continue to meet the following conditions:

**(a)** **Approval and Oversight:** The designation as a Unified Entity is granted by METI Administration, contingent on the Custodian’s demonstrated capacity to maintain unbiased, rigorous data validation protocols and adhere to METI’s principles for data integrity, security and traceability.

**(b)** **Third-Party Audit Requirement:** Despite internal verification capabilities, Unified Entities are subject to periodic third-party audits by METI Administration to ensure ongoing compliance with Rulebook requirements. This additional oversight maintains data integrity and impartiality, preventing conflicts of interest within Unified Entity operations.

**(c)** **Conditions for Internal Verification:** As a Unified Entity, the Custodian must document robust internal processes for data validation, which must meet or exceed the requirements typically applied to independent verification bodies. These processes are outlined in the Custodian’s Local Working Instructions (LWI) and are reviewed periodically by METI.

### 4.3.   Annual Accreditation Process:

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.3.1. Certification Mailings**</mark>_

Each year, METI Administrators will distribute certification mailings electronically to all Custodians. This process allows Custodians to review and verify the accuracy of the data they have provided, ensuring it remains current and correct. Custodians must provide feedback and revisions if discrepancies or missing information are identified.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.3.2. Certification Status**</mark>_

Once reviewed and updated data is approved, METI registers the Custodian’s data as “Certified by the Member,” signaling to market participants and third-party verifiers that the data has been actively verified and certified by the Custodian.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.3.3. Continuous Updates**</mark>_

Custodians shall notify METI Administrators of any significant data changes or corporate actions throughout the year to maintain the accuracy and reliability of data between annual certification periods.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**4.3.4. Accreditation Fee**</mark>_

The SSID Conflict Resolution Process is a structured approach to resolving disputes involving SSIDs. Steps include:

**(a) Pre-Dispute Communication:** Encourage members to resolve potential conflicts through prompt internal discussions.

**(b) Formal METI Review:** Submit a conflict resolution request to METI, which will acknowledge and review the submission within five (5) business days.

**(c) Investigation and Resolution Timeline:** METI aims to resolve conflicts within forty-five (45) business days. Parties dissatisfied with initial outcomes may enter mediation or proceed to arbitration under METI’s Terms of Use.

Since the MSL permits conflicting SSIDs to exist in an encumbered state until the parties resolve the overlap, Members are encouraged but not obligated to proceed through each of these stages. This flexible, non-binding process allows members to manage their conflicts efficiently while ensuring fairness and transparency within the METI ecosystem.

### 9.1.   Pre-Dispute Assessment and Acting Quickly

Before a conflict arises, members are encouraged to conduct regular assessments of their data submissions and understand their obligations and potential risk areas. This proactive approach allows members to anticipate issues, and in cases where a conflict may arise, METI recommends these initial steps:

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.1.1. Prompt Communication**</mark>_

Members should immediately discuss potential conflicts with their internal teams and, where relevant, with land stewards or operators. Prompt action can prevent escalation and the loss of critical information.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">9.1.2. Engagement with Farm Partners, MRV Providers, and Value Chain Members</mark>_

When a potential conflict is identified, members should reach out to involved farm partners or MRV providers to clarify any discrepancies. Many conflicts can be quickly resolved at this stage by allowing these parties the chance to review and correct data.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.1.3. Initiating METI’s SSID Conflict Resolution Program**</mark>_

If direct discussions do not resolve the issue, members may proceed voluntarily to METI’s formal conflict resolution process as outlined below.

### 9.2.   Formal SSID Conflict Resolution by METI Administration

If members choose to use METI’s structured conflict resolution process, METI Administrators oversee the following steps:

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.2.1. Submission of Conflicts**</mark>_

Members submit a formal SSID conflict resolution request via METI’s designated electronic form (See Appendix 1). The request should detail the conflict, SSID identifiers, involved parties, and relevant evidence as outlined in [Section 6](source-rulebook-draft.md#id-6.-chain-of-custody-documentation-requirements). METI reserves the right to evaluate and respond to the conflict submission as appropriate.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.2.2. Review and Acknowledgment**</mark>_

METI will acknowledge receipt of the conflict submission within five (5) business days and conduct an initial review to assess whether the conflict is eligible for METI’s resolution process or requires a different approach.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.2.3. Investigation Period**</mark>_

METI Administrators conduct an investigation to assess the validity of the conflict, which may involve reviewing relevant data and records and requesting further information from members.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.2.4. Resolution Timeline**</mark>_

METI aims to provide an initial resolution within forty-five (45) business days of acknowledgment. If additional time is needed, METI will inform the parties of an updated timeline.

### 9.3.   Negotiation

If the initial METI review does not resolve the conflict to the parties' satisfaction, members may voluntarily move to the Negotiation phase, a direct, collaborative approach aimed at reaching a mutually agreeable solution.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.3.1. Negotiation Procedure**</mark>_

By mutual agreement, METI Administrators may introduce members to engage directly in discussions to explore resolutions. This stage encourages parties to exchange ideas, explore solutions, and work toward a compromise that addresses both parties’ interests.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">9.3.2. Escalation Trigger</mark>_&#x20;

If negotiation is unsuccessful within thirty (30) business days, or the parties prefer an alternative approach, they may proceed to mediation or arbitration.

### 9.4.   Mediation by METI Administrator or Neutral Third-Party

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.4.1. Mediation Options**</mark>_

Mediation can be facilitated by METI Administrator, a member of the METI Governance Committee (not involved in the dispute), another METI Member (not involved in the dispute), or a qualified third-party mediator approved by METI Administrators. All costs of mediation, including fees, are borne by the disputing parties.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.4.2. Mediation Procedure**</mark>_

The mediator facilitates discussions to help parties reach a collaborative, non-binding solution. Mediation remains voluntary throughout, allowing parties to opt out if preferred.

_<mark style="color:red;">**9.4.3. Confidentiality**</mark>_

All information shared during mediation remains confidential to protect member privacy and encourage open dialogue. Neither MillPont nor the mediator will disclose details unless legally mandated.

### 9.5.   Transition to Arbitration&#x20;

If mediation does not yield a resolution or the parties opt to proceed without mediation, Members may voluntarily elect to move to arbitration in accordance with the procedures described in METI’s Terms of Use [Section 20](../operative-documents/meti-terms-of-use.md#id-20.3.-arbitration).

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.5.1. Arbitration Administration**</mark>_

Arbitration is administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), with options tailored to the size of the dispute:

**(a)** Expedited Commercial Rules for disputes up to $100,000.

**(b)** Commercial Arbitration Rules for disputes exceeding $100,000.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.5.2. Arbitration Procedures**</mark>_

(a) Limited Disclosures: Disclosure is restricted and managed by agreement or as ordered by the arbitrator.

(b) Confidentiality and Finality: Arbitration proceedings and awards are confidential. A final award may be confirmed in an appropriate court, ensuring the privacy and finality of the process.

### 9.6.   Documentation and Recordkeeping

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.6.1. Record of Proceedings**</mark>_

All stages of conflict resolution, from initial METI review to negotiation, mediation, and arbitration, will be documented. Records will be securely stored and disclosed only when legally required or to parties directly involved.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">**9.6.2. Confidentiality Assurance**</mark>_

METI ensures that all dispute-related records remain confidential and only disclosed to the extent legally mandated.

### 9.7.   Unresolved SSID Conflicts

For conflicts that remain unresolved, METI allows conflicting SSIDs to exist in an encumbered Conflict status on the Source Ledger.

_<mark style="color:red;">**9.7.1. Encumbered Conflict Status**</mark>_

Unresolved SSID conflicts will maintain an encumbered status on the Source Ledger until the conflict is resolved.

The METI Rulebook is updated quarterly to incorporate minor adjustments, clarifications, and non-substantive changes. These updates are intended to enhance clarity, ensure compliance, and support efficient operations.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">11.1.2. Annual Comprehensive Update</mark>_

Once a year, METI Administration conducts a comprehensive review of the Rulebook to incorporate substantial updates, strategic improvements, and necessary regulatory changes. This annual update serves as a broader opportunity to address significant policy changes and refine the Rulebook to align with METI’s long-term goals and evolving standards in the environmental markets sector.

### 11.2.   Update Procedures

#### _<mark style="color:red;">11.2.1. Proposal Collection and Compilation</mark>_

METI Administration collects proposed updates from a variety of sources, including regulatory changes, internal audits, member feedback, and operational reviews. Each proposal is documented in a Change Proposal Document, detailing the rationale, anticipated impact, and any regulatory or operational requirements. Administration presents the compiled proposals and feedback to the Governance Committee for review and prioritization thirty (30) days prior to scheduled quarterly meetings.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">11.2.2. Review and Vetting by Governance Committee</mark>_

The Governance Committee, consisting of legal, compliance, METI members, and subject matter experts, reviews each proposal to ensure alignment with METI’s mission, regulatory standards, and the Rulebook’s objectives.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">11.2.3. Preliminary Assessment and Voting</mark>_

The Committee conducts a preliminary assessment of each proposal to determine its relevance and potential impact. Proposals that receive a simple majority in a preliminary vote proceed to the next stage, the public comment period.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">11.2.4. Public Comment Period</mark>_

METI Administration posts the proposed updates on the Service Site under “Notice of Proposed Rulebook Updates for Public Comment.” A 30-day comment period allows members and stakeholders to review and provide feedback.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">11.2.5. Final Review, Adjustment, and Voting</mark>_

The Governance Committee reviews feedback from the public comment period and incorporates relevant adjustments into the proposed updates to improve clarity, address operational concerns, or refine compliance measures. The Governance Committee holds a final vote on the adjusted updates. A two-thirds majority is required for approval, and significant updates require endorsement by the METI Executive Board to ensure strategic alignment.

#### _<mark style="color:red;">11.2.6. Monitoring and Adjustment</mark>_

Following implementation, the METI Administrator initiates a 60-day Cure Period to monitor the effectiveness of the updates, ensuring that they meet their intended objectives without unintended impacts. During this Cure Period, METI Administration gathers additional feedback from members regarding any challenges or unforeseen issues. If necessary, METI Administration will make adjustments to ensure compliance and support alignment with the Rulebook’s standards.

### 11.3.   Effective Date

Quarterly updates take effect on the first day of the following quarter. Annual updates are implemented at the beginning of the second quarter of the calendar year, allowing adequate time for members to prepare.
