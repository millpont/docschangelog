# Frequently Asked Questions

## **What does METI provide that other platforms do not?**

METI is an industry-first digital claims clearinghouse, utilizing [cryptographic privacy-preserving techniques](https://csrc.nist.gov/Presentations/2023/stppa6-iso-iec-fhe) to assign unique identifiers, or “thumbprints,” to data. This ensures data confidentiality while enabling third-party verification, making claims credible, comparable, and traceable. Additionally, METI integrates a secure source ledger and a conflict resolution process, reducing duplication of claims across platforms, projects, and registries allowing members to trust the integrity and exclusivity of their environmental claims without compromise.

## What specific services does METI offer?

METI offers foundational services to support secure environmental claims:

* **Data Transparency and Management**: A digital ledger that enables access to reliable, privacy-preserving data.
* **Conflict Resolution:** A streamlined process to resolve overlapping claims, reducing duplicated assets across projects.
* **Verification and Auditing:** Comprehensive tools to track and make climate project data reviewable by third parties and regulatory bodies.
* **Integration with Financial Processes:** Connection to financial systems to facilitate project financing and provide a trusted foundation for climate markets​.

## **What is METI’s business model?**

METI operates a membership-based model, METI Originate, with options suited for a range of organizational structures and scales:

* **Basic:** Ideal for small projects and pilots, offering 100 secure sources per year, with an option to add more at a per-source fee.
* **Standard:** For growing businesses, including 15,000 secure sources and API access with scalable fees for additional sources.
* **Enterprise:** Designed for high-volume marketplaces and registries, offering 95,000 secure sources, API access, and advisory support, with customizable fees based on usage​.&#x20;

## What data does METI store, and what measures does it take to protect data?

METI stores essential metadata related to the [Source](frequently-asked-questions.md#what-are-secure-source-ids-ssids) of environmental benefits, such as the geospatial and temporal extent of a project claim (e.g., an agricultural project from 2020 to 2030). Each source is unique per environmental attribute (e.g., carbon, biodiversity), mitigating duplicated assets. METI only stores data needed for uniqueness and provenance, preserving privacy and competitive information, while promoting transparency with easy validation and verification.&#x20;

To safeguard this data, METI uses encryption technologies like [Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)](https://csrc.nist.gov/Presentations/2023/stppa6-iso-iec-fhe), allowing computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive details. Information that might reveal personal details, such as location data, is encrypted to allow computations, like conflict checking, without revealing actual values. METI excludes [Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/Safeguarding\_PII\_Fact\_Sheet\_Fillable\_1\_3\_22.pdf), such as landowner names, from its system and is working toward SOC 2 compliance to uphold data security standards​.

## If I am already using blockchain, do I need to use METI Originate?

Blockchain tokenization can be powerful but does not inherently prevent double-counting. Only tokens with cryptographically-linked MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) audit trails provide full claim integrity. METI Originate complements blockchain by offering a cryptographic bridge across diverse on- and off-chain solutions, providing a unified checkpoint for data verification across protocols, platforms, and systems, enhancing the security and reliability of existing blockchain applications​.

## Who is a Custodian?

A Custodian holds ownership or administrative authority over SSIDs and EACs. Custodians, typically project developers or administrators, are responsible for the issuance and management of SSIDs and EACs, ensuring claims data is governed with the highest standards of accountability and exclusivity.

## What are Secure Source IDs (SSIDs)?

SSIDs are unique 16-character identifiers embedded in digital certificates for sustainable projects. Using cryptographic hash functions, SSIDs create unique, comparable claim fingerprints, blending geospatial, temporal, and environmental data. These identifiers enable efficient underwriting, verification, and secure data comparison across platforms​.

## What are Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs)?

EACs are market instruments that represent the intangible property rights to claim the quantified environmental benefits generated by sustainable practices and ecosystem services connected to water, carbon, and biodiversity. Issued and managed by Custodians, they can includes one or more SSIDs, providing integrity, exclusivity and traceability. EACs are mediums of exchange for the transfer of environmental assets across platforms and between counterparties.

## What is METI’s long-term vision for climate markets?

METI aims to create resilient infrastructure that fosters institutional investment, supports market innovation, and enables scalable and future-regulated environments. By engaging early with market participants, METI supports a system that can evolve similarly to support  the scale for regulated markets such as commodities, equities, and interest rate products. This scalable infrastructure positions METI to meet the increasing accountability demands in global climate markets.

## Why do we need climate markets?

To achieve global climate goals, companies need to reduce emissions quickly and effectively. However, decarbonizing at the necessary pace remains challenging, and climate markets are essential for directing capital toward projects that reduce and remove emissions worldwide. These markets—driven by insetting, offsetting, low-carbon biofuels and climate-smart —can scale to remove billions of tons of carbon annually, far beyond current trading levels.&#x20;
