Section,Author,Type,Comment,Referenced Text,Materiality Rationale
1.0.,Steve Francis,"Question, Suggestion","The concept of a Registry (e.g., current owner of an EAC) separate from the MSL needs more explanation. If the goal of MSL is to verify ownership, separation could create verification issues. Possibly anticipate cryptographic methods to update EAC ownership upon transfer.","An electronic accounting ledger within the METI Platform that records, stores, and tracks data submissions and claims associated with SSIDs and their linked EACs. The Source Ledger maintains a transparent chain of custody and ensures the secure, verifiable provenance of environmental claims, particularly in agricultural production systems. Serving as the foundational tool for establishing and securing the exclusivity of EAC ownership, it also prevents the duplication of EAC issuances at the point of origin, supporting the integrity and trustworthiness of environmental transactions.",Adds or clarifies key definitions impacting scope or interpretation.
1.1. Purpose,Robert Parkhurst,Question,Could you expand this to inventory approaches as well? That is where the market is headed.,"Environmental Attribute Certificates: A tradeable instrument representing intangible property rights used to quantify, verify, and track the ecosystem service benefits of climate mitigation projects. EACs may vary in their traceability, supporting ownership claims for activities like carbon reduction and renewable energy production.",Material operational or compliance change affecting implementation.
1.3.,Robert Parkhurst,Suggestion,Similar definition to above. I recommend only having one.,"Omnibus Custodian: The individual or organization responsible for the management, administration, and oversight of one or more SSIDs and EACs on behalf of another individual or organization. An Omnibus Custodian has a signed Declaration of Agency Form (See Appendix 1) on file with the Administration for each Omnibus Custodian Account it oversees and administers on the Source Ledger.",Adds or clarifies key definitions impacting scope or interpretation.
1.3.,Bob Lawrence,Suggestion,"General Definitions - add ""Project Proponent"" to definition of Custodian: "".","An individual, entity, or organization responsible for the custody, management, and administrative oversight of one or more Secure Source Identifiers (SSIDs). Custodians oversee the issuance, distribution, and tracking of SSIDs and may also underwrite Environmental Attribute Certificates linked to those identifiers. To serve as a Custodian, a party must maintain an active commercial agreement with the relevant Source owner (such as a Landowner or Operator) or with a Beneficiary whose agreement is tied to the Source. Custodians have privileged access to METI’s clearing services, including rights to create, modify, and manage records within the METI Source Ledger. They must comply with all applicable Terms of Use and Rulebook standards governing data integrity and regulatory compliance. ",Adds or clarifies key definitions impacting scope or interpretation.
1.3.,Steve Francis,Suggestion,"The definition of 'Source' as having a permanent contiguous boundary could benefit from defining an 'SSID collection' to describe grouped SSIDs with common practices, ownership, and Custodian.","For agricultural-based projects, a source is the point of origin of an EAC, an identifiable measurement point at the beginning of the EAC lifecycle, and is considered an individual contiguous parcel that is the smallest unit of land with: 1) A permanent, contiguous boundary; 2) Common land cover, management practice, or operational facility; 3) Common ownership or group of Land Owners and Operators, and; 4) A common project administrator (i.e. Custodian). ",Adds or clarifies key definitions impacting scope or interpretation.
1.4.,Bob Lawrence,Suggestion,Add Omnibus Custodian to the bottom icon row in the METI Organizational Structure diagram.,,"Alters governance authority, roles, or oversight responsibilities."
2.0.,Steve Francis,"Question, Suggestion",Does the METI Governance Committee have the power to replace MillPont as the Administrators if they are unable to maintain the platform and MSL? Suggest clarifying whether this is an open system that could survive MillPont's failure or just an advisory body. Consider replacing some uses of 'MillPont' with 'METI Administrators' for consistency (noted in 3.6 & 3.7).,,"Alters governance authority, roles, or oversight responsibilities."
2.1.,Bob Lawrence,Suggestion,"Add ""to provide recommendations from members from members to METI Administrators"" as role of Governance Committee","The METI Governance Committee is comprised of METI Members, industry stakeholders, and independent experts. This governance structure ensures that METI remains aligned with the principles of transparency, integrity, and continuous improvement. This body is responsible for:","Alters governance authority, roles, or oversight responsibilities."
2.1.2.,Robert Parkhurst,Question,Are you planning to have more than one Administrator? How would that work?,['Advising METI Administrators'],Material operational or compliance change affecting implementation.
2.4.4. Transparency,Robert Parkhurst,Suggestion,"I would reframe to talk about making the data available do that the claims can be verified. I would also add what data should be public. Producer information should be confidential, but most of the data should be public.","2.4.4. Transparency', 'Ensuring environmental claims are verifiable and contribute to sustainability goals, reinforcing trust in the platform.']",Material operational or compliance change affecting implementation.
3.1.,Robert Parkhurst,Question,"What data is public? How is it accessed? How much history is retained? What about the processes? You could mention that all the process documentation, including this Rulebook is publicly accessible. Are previous versions of the documents also publicly available?","Transparency is a cornerstone of MSL operations, ensuring that all participants have access to essential information:",Introduces or modifies core operational procedures.
3.1.1.,Robert Parkhurst,"Question, Suggestion",What does Confidential Transparency mean in the context of METI?,"Confidential Transparency': the MSL upholds the right to comprehensive information about the origin, attributes, and handling of environmental assets while balancing the protection of data sovereignty, anonymity, and trade secrets. This approach supports traceability for producers and verification confidence for end-users.",Adds or clarifies key definitions impacting scope or interpretation.
3.3 Traceability and Chain of Custody,Steve Francis,"Question, Suggestion","SSID resolution may depend on claim type overlap resolution (e.g., soil carbon vs. biodiversity claims are non-overlapping; soil carbon vs. reforestation may overlap depending on protocol). Consider automation of resolution via a claim type ontology.",,Introduces or modifies core operational procedures.
3.3.3. Compatibility with External Systems,Robert Parkhurst,Question,You might want to expand about how this is done. Are you thinking about APIs or other ways to integrate systems?,"METI integrates with member-managed systems to align data and avoid duplication, enhancing the overall traceability of environmental assets",Material operational or compliance change affecting implementation.
3.4.2. Controlled Access,Robert Parkhurst,Question,"If I am an authorized member, what data can I have access to? Can I access just my data or other project data? What about administrators? Can they access all the data? Put another way, what are the different types of controlled access in METI","Access to data is restricted to authorized members, ensuring secure data handling",Material operational or compliance change affecting implementation.
3.5.1. Support for Innovation,Robert Parkhurst,Question,Markets like stability. How do you plan to implement new governance models while maintaining stable rules?,METI fosters the implementation and exploration of new governance models and environmental accounting frameworks,"Alters governance authority, roles, or oversight responsibilities."

4.1.1. Commercial Relationships,Bob Lawrence,Suggestion,The commercial agreements should clearly define the services provided and ensure that the registration and management of SSIDs is aligned with those services.,,"Strengthens data security, integrity, or operational resilience."
4.1.3. SSID Requests,Bob Lawrence,Suggestion,"SSID requests may include requests for ex-ante requests for ex-ante EACs if such EACs if such EACs and projections and projections are supported are supported by sufficient by sufficient documentation and are in accordance with and are in accordance with underlying standards underlying standards , protocols, and methodologies.",,Introduces or modifies core operational procedures.
4.2.3. Local Working Instructions,Robert Parkhurst,Question,I assume crop rotations are not an issue? Should you clarify? How are the historic EACs handled? Is that a concern?,"(ii) ', 'Common land cover, management practice, or operational facility; The registration of a Source may expire after a defined period from the date of its initial registration, as specified in the commercial agreement/s between a Custodian and ', 'Land Owner', ' and Operator. ",Material operational or compliance change affecting implementation.
4.2.5. Unified Entity Requirements,Robert Parkhurst,Suggestion,This is very helpful. I recommend it be echoed in other places in the document related to record retention.,['Administration upon request and maintain these records for a minimum period of three years following SSID expiration'],Material operational or compliance change affecting implementation.
4.4.1 Grounds for Suspension or Termination,Steve Francis,Suggestion,4.4.1(d) seems not sufficiently different from 4.4.1(b); consider revising for clarity.,"b) Fraudulent Activity or Tampering: Fraudulent actions, intentional
misrepresentation, or tampering with METI data or systems. (d) Any attempt to compromise the proper functioning of METI and the Source
Ledger.",Adds or clarifies key definitions impacting scope or interpretation.
4.4.3 Termination and Reapplication,Steve Francis,Suggestion,The ending of 4.4.3 probably should not refer to 'suspension or'; revise wording for precision.,Reapplication will be permitted provided that the Custodian demonstrates it has remedied all issues that led to the suspension or termination.,Adds or clarifies key definitions impacting scope or interpretation.

5.7 Prohibition of Disruptive Practices,Steve Francis,Suggestion,5.7 (and potentially other behavioral requirements) may be better placed in the Terms of Use instead of the Rulebook.,"5.7.1. Data Submission Integrity
All data must be submitted in good faith for legitimate purposes and should not disrupt the orderly conduct of the platform.
5.7.2. Prohibited Practices
Submission of data with the intent to mislead or overload METI’s systems or those of participants is forbidden. Reckless or intentional practices that could disrupt METI’s operations or clearing services are prohibited.",Material operational or compliance change affecting implementation.
